                                              Bank Account Management System

Overview

This project serves as a simple yet effective bank account management system. It allows users to perform basic financial operations like depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking their account balance. The system is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, along with Node.js and Express for the backend. This README aims to provide a detailed explanation of how the project incorporates key programming concepts such as JavaScript classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally blocks for error handling.


JavaScript Classes

The project employs a JavaScript class named BankAccount to encapsulate all the functionalities and properties related to a bank account. This class has three main properties: the name of the account holder, the type of account, and the current balance. It also includes methods for depositing money into the account, withdrawing money, and checking the current balance. By using a class, we can easily create multiple account instances and perform operations on them, making the code more organized and reusable.


Switch Statements

To handle different user actions like depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance, the project uses a switch statement within a function called performAction. This function is triggered when the user selects an action from a dropdown menu and clicks a button. The switch statement evaluates the selected action and calls the corresponding method from the BankAccount class. This approach makes the code more maintainable and easier to extend with additional features in the future.


Try-Catch-Finally Blocks

Error handling is an essential aspect of any robust application. In this project, try-catch-finally blocks are used extensively to catch and handle exceptions. For example, if a user tries to withdraw an amount greater than the available balance, the program throws an "Insufficient funds" error. Similarly, invalid inputs for depositing or withdrawing are also caught and handled appropriately. The finally block ensures that certain cleanup actions are performed, regardless of whether an error was thrown or caught, making the application more resilient.


Conclusion

The project effectively demonstrates the practical application of key JavaScript concepts. The BankAccount class provides a structured way to manage individual accounts, the switch statement offers an efficient mechanism to handle various user actions, and the try-catch-finally blocks contribute to the robustness of the application by providing comprehensive error handling. These elements together make the bank account management system a well-rounded project that is both functional and educational.
